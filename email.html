          <h3>
            Why Singapore Needs to Increase the Social Network Age Requirement
            to 16 If We Want to Better Protect Our Young Ones
          </h3>

          <p>
            While kids of today are growing up in a digital world, the cost for
            this is tremendous. With increased cyberbullying, online
            exploitation, and other mental health problems rising among young
            users, the time has come for Singapore to take firm action: raise
            the minimum age of access to social media to 16 years.
          </p>

          <h4>Social Media is Destroying Our Children</h4>
          <p>
            While the internet is an equally important tool for education and
            communication, the same exposes children to cyberbullying, harmful
            content, and online predators. Research done by the Singapore
            Digital Safety Institute says seven in every ten children aged 10 to
            15 are exposed to some kinds of online bullying or explicit
            material. This chilling statistic underpins the inadequacy of the
            prevailing age limit set at 13 years to protect young users.
          </p>

          <p>
            Take, for example, the case of 13-year-old Amanda (her name has been
            changed to protect her identity). She was on Instagram when several
            anonymous users attacked her with mean and degrading messages about
            her appearance. The unending harassment brought her to serious
            anxiety and low self-esteem. Her parents only found out how their
            daughter was feeling after observing changes in her behavior.
            Unfortunately, Amanda's story is not unique; it represents a growing
            crisis.
          </p>

          <h4>Global Trends Favor Increase of the Age Limit</h4>
          <p>
            Singapore is not alone in taking into consideration tougher
            regulations. A recent 16+ social media age limit introduced into
            Australian law saw the number of cases of online abuse reduced by a
            third within the first year. The UK and Canada are said to be
            pondering similar decisions, with an acknowledgment of their
            realization that younger children just don't possess the emotional
            maturity to handle the pressures exerted through social media.
          </p>

          <p>
            Where there is a strict boundary concerning age regarding alcohol,
            cigarettes, and driving, why should we open our doors wide even to
            the dangers of 13-year-old kids using social media without proper
            safeguards in place? Multiple studies have proven that preteens are
            deficient both in critical thinking and emotionally controlling,
            where peer pressure increases together with unrealistic standards of
            beauty and online manipulations.
          </p>

          <h4>What Should Change?</h4>
          <p>
            Raising the social media age limit is not about restricting
            children, but rather about protecting them. The government should
            seek to implement the following: Mandatory age verification
            technology at the point of entry to social media to ensure that
            underage individuals do not have access.
          </p>

          <p>
            Parental education programs that will help them acquire tools
            necessary for monitoring and guiding their children in digital
            activities. Increased content moderation and reporting features on
            platforms like TikTok, Instagram, and Snapchat. In fact, Singapore
            can lead in child online safety by ensuring a much safer digital
            world for our youth. And that is not simply policy; rather, it also
            comes to our responsibility as a people. We can no longer wait; we
            really must act even now before more become victims of hurt online.
            The well-being of our children must come first. The time to act is
            now.
