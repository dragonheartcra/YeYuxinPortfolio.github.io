                <p>Dear Ms. Han,</p>

                <p>I hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out on behalf of SCS in regard to the issue at hand: a pressing one facing our nation's youth-to-date minimum age for access to social media.</p>

                <div class="email-section">
                    <h3>The Concern:</h3>
                    <p>Indeed, recent studies have placed the number of children in Singapore exposed to harmful online content between the ages of 10 and 15 at more than 70%, covering even cyberbullying and explicit material. The current age limit of 13 years is proving insufficient in protecting our children from these risks.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="email-section">
                    <h3>Our Proposal:</h3>
                    <p>SCS is calling on the government to raise the minimum social media age to 16. The move will give children more time to develop emotional resilience before going onto online platforms, thus reducing exposure to potential harms.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="email-section">
                    <h3>Why This Matters:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Mental Health: Early exposure to social media has been linked to increased rates of anxiety, depression, and low self-esteem among young users.</li>
                        <li>Global Precedents: Of late, countries like Australia have instituted a 16+ social media law and subsequently reported a 30% reduction in the cases of online abuses.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <div class="email-section">
                    <h3>Call to Action:</h3>
                    <p>We believe that together, with your esteemed platform, we can raise awareness and drive meaningful change. We will be happy to provide more information, data, and personal stories that will support this initiative.</p>
                </div>

                <p>Thank you for your attention to this pressing matter. We look forward, when possible, to collaborating and working with you to protect and advance the best interest of Singapore's children.</p>
