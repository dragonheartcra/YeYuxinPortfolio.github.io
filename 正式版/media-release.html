                <p class="date">26 January 2025</p>
                
                <h3>Singapore Children's Society calls upon the Government to raise the minimum age limit of joining social media to 16 years in order to protect children.</h3>

                <p>In an urgent call, the Singapore Children's Society in Singapore pressed the government for strict regulation of social media by raising the minimum age to 16 for those joining. It said there is immense worry about growing incidents of cyberbullying, online exploitation, and even the psychological threats related to these sites among children.</p>

                <p>The government has established an age limit of 13, which is deemed to be too low for protecting the children in the age group of 10-15 years from online harming, which also encompasses harassment and explicit material. According to a study conducted recently by the Singapore Digital Safety Institute in 2024, it has been revealed that the incidents of cyberbullying among preteens have tripled within the last five years, which enhances anxiety, depression, and low self-esteem issues among young users.</p>

                <blockquote>
                    <p>"Allowing young children unrestricted access to social media is like letting them roam the streets unsupervised. Without proper safeguards, they are vulnerable to online predators, harmful content, and cyberbullying," said Ms. June Tan, Executive Director of Singapore Children's Society.</p>
                </blockquote>

                <h4>Global Evidence Supports Stricter Age Limits</h4>
                <p>Singapore is not the first country to consider such regulations. Australia introduced a 16+ social media law last year, which reduced the incidence of online abuse by 30%. The UK and Canada are looking at similar measures. They reason that younger children don't have enough emotional maturity to handle social media responsibly.</p>
                
                <blockquote>
                    <p>"If we have strict age limits for alcohol, smoking, and driving, why do we allow children as young as 13 to be exposed to the dangers of social media?" Tan added.</p>
                </blockquote>

                <h4>Call for Stronger Regulation & Parental Awareness</h4>
                <p>SCS is calling upon the government to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Implement mandatory age verification to prevent underage users from accessing social media platforms.</li>
                    <li>Digital safety education in schools should begin preparing these children to conduct themselves responsibly online.</li>
                    <li>Strengthen parental controls to help caregivers monitor their children's social media use.</li>
                </ul>

                <blockquote>
                    <p>"Raising the social media age of minimum is not anything about restricting children; rather, it's all about protecting them. We urge policymakers, educators, and parents to support this initiative and help us in our initiative for a safer digital environment for our youth," Tan emphasized.</p>

                <h3>Why Singapore Needs to Increase the Social Network Age Requirement to 16 If We Want to Better Protect Our Young Ones</h3>

                <p>While kids of today are growing up in a digital world, the cost for this is tremendous. With increased cyberbullying, online exploitation, and other mental health problems rising among young users, the time has come for Singapore to take firm action: raise the minimum age of access to social media to 16 years.</p>

                <h4>Social Media is Destroying Our Children</h4>
                <p>While the internet is an equally important tool for education and communication, the same exposes children to cyberbullying, harmful content, and online predators. Research done by the Singapore Digital Safety Institute says seven in every ten children aged 10 to 15 are exposed to some kinds of online bullying or explicit material. This chilling statistic underpins the inadequacy of the prevailing age limit set at 13 years to protect young users.</p>

                <p>Take, for example, the case of 13-year-old Amanda (her name has been changed to protect her identity). She was on Instagram when several anonymous users attacked her with mean and degrading messages about her appearance. The unending harassment brought her to serious anxiety and low self-esteem. Her parents only found out how their daughter was feeling after observing changes in her behavior. Unfortunately, Amanda's story is not unique; it represents a growing crisis.</p>

                <h4>Global Trends Favor Increase of the Age Limit</h4>
                <p>Singapore is not alone in taking into consideration tougher regulations. A recent 16+ social media age limit introduced into Australian law saw the number of cases of online abuse reduced by a third within the first year. The UK and Canada are said to be pondering similar decisions, with an acknowledgment of their realization that younger children just don't possess the emotional maturity to handle the pressures exerted through social media.</p>

                <p>Where there is a strict boundary concerning age regarding alcohol, cigarettes, and driving, why should we open our doors wide even to the dangers of 13-year-old kids using social media without proper safeguards in place? Multiple studies have proven that preteens are deficient both in critical thinking and emotionally controlling, where peer pressure increases together with unrealistic standards of beauty and online manipulations.</p>

                <h4>What Should Change?</h4>
                <p>Raising the social media age limit is not about restricting children, but rather about protecting them. The government should seek to implement the following: Mandatory age verification technology at the point of entry to social media to ensure that underage individuals do not have access.</p>

                <p>Parental education programs that will help them acquire tools necessary for monitoring and guiding their children in digital activities. Increased content moderation and reporting features on platforms like TikTok, Instagram, and Snapchat. In fact, Singapore can lead in child online safety by ensuring a much safer digital world for our youth. And that is not simply policy; rather, it also comes to our responsibility as a people. We can no longer wait; we really must act even now before more become victims of hurt online. The well-being of our children must come first. The time to act is now.</p>
