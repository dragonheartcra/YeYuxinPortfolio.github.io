            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>
              Ladies and gentlemen, distinguished guests, and concerned parents,
              thank you for being here today. We are gathered here not just as
              professionals, educators, and policymakers but as protectors of
              our children's future.
            </p>

            <p>
              Today, I rise to address an issue that refuses to take a back
              seat. Our children are in danger-not from the streets but from
              their screens. The same devices meant to connect us have also
              become windows to the dark world of cyberbullying, inappropriate
              content, and sexual predators.
            </p>

            <p>
              Singapore has always been at the forefront of protecting its
              youth, but the current minimum age for access to social media-13
              years-is just not enough. Research proves that children below the
              age of 16 years are not emotionally mature enough to use social
              media safely and are prone to manipulation, mental health
              problems, and exploitation.
            </p>

            <p>
              Singapore Children's Society is raising a siren of alarm for
              urgent action: We must raise the age limit of the social media use
              policy to 16 years and enforce more strict regulation to safeguard
              our children from their digital harm.
            </p>

            <h3>
              Central Argument 1: Mental Health Crisis Among Young Social Media
              Users
            </h3>
            <p>
              Research by the Singapore Digital Safety Institute shows the
              stunning truth that cyberbullying cases have tripled in the last
              five years, while over 70% of the children aged 10-15 years have
              faced online harassment or harmful content.
            </p>

            <p>
              Allow me to share a story with you. Amanda-13-year-old young
              girl-was harassed more than once on social media. Anonymous
              bullies made fun of her appearance while sending her hate
              messages, and even spread false rumors about her. Anxiety,
              depression, and self-isolation: that story led to such outcomes.
              Her parents didn't know until many months later how much damage
              had been done through her changed behaviors.
            </p>

            <p>
              Unfortunately, Amanda is not alone. She is just one in the
              multitudes of children trapped in such experiences here in
              Singapore. Researchers found that those who use social media over
              three hours per day have triple the rate-or even twice of
              developing severe mental health problems for kids: low
              self-esteem, suicidal ideation among teens, etc., and there would
              be increased psychological vulnerability due specifically because
              their lives become too predictable or lack significant challenge
              present during key human developmental stage.
            </p>

            <p>
              We have to ask ourselves: why are we putting our children through
              these dangers at this tender age of their lives? Raising the age
              limit to 16 is not about restricting freedom; it is an opportunity
              for children to develop emotional resilience before being released
              into the online world.

            <h3>
              Central Argument 2: The Global Trend Toward Increased Regulation
            </h3>
            <p>
              We are not fighting this fight alone; all over the world,
              countries wake up to this reality-one harmful for young users on
              social media.
            </p>

            <p>
              Australia has already passed a 16+ social media law, and in just
              one year, cases of cyberbullying dropped by 30%. The United
              Kingdom and Canada are considering similar policies. Singapore
              cannot afford to lag behind.
            </p>

            <p>
              The reasons are many, but let us be honest: some may say that
              parental supervision is enough. Parents cannot monitor their
              children 24/7, and algorithms on these platforms make sure that
              children get to see harmful content, even when children are simply
              scrolling. From unrealistic beauty standards to encouraging
              self-harm, social media manipulates young minds in ways we're just
              learning about.
            </p>

            <p>
              If we have strict legal age limits for smoking, drinking, and
              driving, why on earth are we giving 13-year-olds free rein on
              platforms that can cause lasting psychological harm?
            </p>

            <p>
              Increasing the age limit is not a recommendation; it is an
              imperative.
            </p>

          <div class="speech-section">
            <h3>Conclusion: A Call to Action</h3>
            <p>Parents, policymakers, educators-the time to act is now.</p>

            <p>
              We cannot afford waiting until more children fall victim to online
              predators of cyberbullying or turn into mental hazards. Raising
              the minimum social media age to 16 basically is not at all about
              lost freedoms; rather, it covers the assurance of our budding
              children growing up responsibly in a safer digital timescape.
            </p>

            <p>Here is what we have to do together:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Implement strict age verification to ensure no underage users
                can access any social media.
              </li>
              <li>
                Push for stronger content moderation laws to take away harmful
                material.
              </li>
              <li>
                Educate parents and teachers in the use of digital safety so
                that they are able to instruct children well.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              I urge every one of you to heed the call for the Social Media Age
              Reform Bill. Make noise, sign, petition, speak with your MPâ€”tell
              them this is not optional, this is our duty. Thank you. Together,
              for a safer digital future.
