          <h3>
            Singapore Children's Society calls upon the Government to raise the
            minimum age limit of joining social media to 16 years in order to
            protect children.
          </h3>

          <p>
            In an urgent call, the Singapore Children's Society in Singapore
            pressed the government for strict regulation of social media by
            raising the minimum age to 16 for those joining. It said there is
            immense worry about growing incidents of cyberbullying, online
            exploitation, and even the psychological threats related to these
            sites among children.
          </p>

          <p>
            The government has established an age limit of 13, which is deemed
            to be too low for protecting the children in the age group of 10-15
            years from online harming, which also encompasses harassment and
            explicit material. According to a study conducted recently by the
            Singapore Digital Safety Institute in 2024, it has been revealed
            that the incidents of cyberbullying among preteens have tripled
            within the last five years, which enhances anxiety, depression, and
            low self-esteem issues among young users.
          </p>

          <blockquote>
            <p>
              "Allowing young children unrestricted access to social media is
              like letting them roam the streets unsupervised. Without proper
              safeguards, they are vulnerable to online predators, harmful
              content, and cyberbullying," said Ms. June Tan, Executive Director
              of Singapore Children's Society.
            </p>
          </blockquote>

          <h4>Global Evidence Supports Stricter Age Limits</h4>
          <p>
            Singapore is not the first country to consider such regulations.
            Australia introduced a 16+ social media law last year, which reduced
            the incidence of online abuse by 30%. The UK and Canada are looking
            at similar measures. They reason that younger children don't have
            enough emotional maturity to handle social media responsibly.
          </p>

          <blockquote>
            <p>
              "If we have strict age limits for alcohol, smoking, and driving,
              why do we allow children as young as 13 to be exposed to the
              dangers of social media?" Tan added.
            </p>
          </blockquote>

          <h4>Call for Stronger Regulation & Parental Awareness</h4>
          <p>SCS is calling upon the government to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Implement mandatory age verification to prevent underage users
              from accessing social media platforms.
            </li>
            <li>
              Digital safety education in schools should begin preparing these
              children to conduct themselves responsibly online.
            </li>
            <li>
              Strengthen parental controls to help caregivers monitor their
              children's social media use.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <blockquote>
            <p>
              "Raising the social media age of minimum is not anything about
              restricting children; rather, it's all about protecting them. We
              urge policymakers, educators, and parents to support this
              initiative and help us in our initiative for a safer digital
              environment for our youth," Tan emphasized.

            Subject: Urgent: Increase Social Media Age Limit to 16-Years-Old to
            Protect Singapore's Youths
          </h2>

          <p>Dear Ms. Han,</p>

          <p>
            I hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out on behalf of
            SCS in regard to the issue at hand: a pressing one facing our
            nation's youth-to-date minimum age for access to social media.
          </p>

          <div class="email-section">
            <h3>The Concern:</h3>
            <p>
              Indeed, recent studies have placed the number of children in
              Singapore exposed to harmful online content between the ages of 10
              and 15 at more than 70%, covering even cyberbullying and explicit
              material. The current age limit of 13 years is proving
              insufficient in protecting our children from these risks.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="email-section">
            <h3>Our Proposal:</h3>
            <p>
              SCS is calling on the government to raise the minimum social media
              age to 16. The move will give children more time to develop
              emotional resilience before going onto online platforms, thus
              reducing exposure to potential harms.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="email-section">
            <h3>Why This Matters:</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Mental Health: Early exposure to social media has been linked to
                increased rates of anxiety, depression, and low self-esteem
                among young users.
              </li>
              <li>
                Global Precedents: Of late, countries like Australia have
                instituted a 16+ social media law and subsequently reported a
                30% reduction in the cases of online abuses.
              </li>
            </ul>
